      "text": "I recently stayed at the Belfort location and unfortunately, it was a disappointing experience. The mattresses were incredibly uncomfortable, making it difficult to get a good night's sleep. On top of that, the air conditioning didn’t work properly, leaving the room either too warm or too humid.\nIf you’re considering staying here, I strongly recommend requesting a room as far away from the pool and restaurant as possible. Over the weekend, there was a loud party, and despite the obvious disturbance to hotel guests, nothing was done to address the noise.\nThe location is not ideal if you don't have a vehicle.\nThe 'surprise' fees, not honoured through our Booking.com price are a wonderful topper too.\nOverall, I wouldn’t stay here again nor would I recommend it.",

      "text": "I am extremely disappointed with the service and hidden fees at this hotel. The experience has been far below what I expected. I'm staying at a different hotel nearby but came back to visit a friend who is staying here, only to be told I’d have to pay an outrageous $140 USD just to go up and see them. This is beyond unreasonable, and no one even explained this upfront.\n\nOn top of that, the reception desk staff were incredibly rude and dismissive when I questioned this fee. It felt like they had no interest in helping or accommodating me, and I left feeling unwelcome and frustrated. For what they charge, you’d expect much better service and clearer policies.\n\nWith the combination of hidden fees and poor customer service, I can't recommend this place to anyone looking for a pleasant, welcoming experience. Definitely will not be returning.\n\nI waited in the lobby for about 40 min se then we can head out.",
